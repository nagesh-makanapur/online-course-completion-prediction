ðŸŽ“ Online Course Completion Prediction

The **Online Course Completion Prediction** system is a machine learning-based solution aimed at identifying whether a student will complete an online course. By analyzing behavioral, demographic, and interaction data, this project enables education platforms and course providers to enhance retention, personalize experiences, and intervene proactively.

> ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Predict the likelihood of a student completing an online course based on historical data.  
> ðŸ“Œ **Target Column**: `completed_course` (Binary: 1 = Completed, 0 = Not Completed)
